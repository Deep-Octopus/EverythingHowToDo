# Everything How To Do

A centralized repository for personal operation guides, usage instructions, and process specifications. Covering software, hardware, workflows, and daily scenarios, with standardized documentation formats for easy maintenance and retrieval.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository is designed to systematically manage personal "instructional documents" to avoid scattered notes and improve efficiency in finding/updating content. All documents follow a unified template, ensuring consistency in expression and structure.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Documents are categorized by **application scenarios** (adjustable based on actual content):

| Category    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Software/` | Usage guides for software, tools, and applications (e.g., software operation, configuration) |
| `Hardware/` | Operation instructions for hardware devices (e.g., equipment operation, troubleshooting) |
| `Workflow/` | Process specifications (e.g., work procedures, collaboration rules) |
| `Daily/`    | Daily scenario guides (e.g., household appliances, daily tools) |
| `Template/` | Standard templates for creating new documents (see `Template.md`) |

## 📝 Document Specification

To ensure readability and consistency, all documents in this repository follow these rules:

1. **Naming Convention**
    Use clear, descriptive titles in Chinese/English (consistent language). Format:
    - Chinese: `[对象]_[操作/场景]_[类型].md` (e.g., `VSCode_插件配置_使用指南.md`)
    - English: `[Object]_[Operation]_[Type].md` (e.g., `Printer_Connection_Guide.md`)
2. **Format Requirement**
    - Use Markdown syntax (support lists, images, links, code blocks).
    - For screenshots: Embed with `![Description](image-link)` (drag images to GitHub editor to auto-upload).
    - Avoid redundant content: Reuse links for repeated concepts (e.g., reference basic guides in advanced documents).
3. **Version Control**
    Add version number to titles when updating core content (e.g., `Excel_Advanced_Filter_Guide_v2.0.md`).

## 📌 Update Log

## 💡 Usage Tips
